      <Typography>Children’s Privacy</Typography>
      <Typography>
        These Services address anyone under the age of 13 as well because my
        games are children friendly so anyone play them. I do not knowingly
        collect personally identifiable information from children under 13. In
        the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal
        information then their information will be secured as I mentioned
        earlier for other age groups.
